# Fractal benchmark

In this article we will chose different techniques to display a simple fractal
made only with dots, but a lot of them. We are not studying fractals, but more
how we can use all the power of modern javascript techniques to get the better
performances.
So we will start with the slower solution and we will walk to the fastest.

The article has been tested with __Firefox 52__.

## The drawing principal of our fractal

Before starting to dig into the code, we need to know how we can build our
fractal made of dots.

We start at the origin point: (0,0). We call it __V__ and it is a 2 dimensional
vector. Let __V'__ be the next point. We compute it like this:

<div class="boxed">V' = M.V + T</div>

Where __M__ is a 2x2 matrix and __T__ is a 2 dimensional vector.

This is not all. To get the gorgeous fern, you need 4 couples (__M__, __T__).
At each step, you randomly choose one of these couples.

Here are the data we used for this fern:


| Name | Probability | M11     | M12     | M21     | M22     |   Tx    |   Ty    |
| -:-- | ----------: | ------: | ------: | ------: | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| A    | 85%         | 0.85    | 0.04    | -0.04   | 0.85    | 0       | 1.6     |
| B    | 1%          | 0       | 0       | 0       | 0.16    | 0       | 0       |
| C    | 7%          | 0.2     | -0.26   | 0.23    | 0.22    | 0       | 1.6     |
| D    | 7%          | -0.15   | 0.28    | 0.26    | 0.24    | 0       | 0.44    |

## First approach: __fillRect()__

We start by using the 2D context function `fillRect( x, y, 1, 1 )`.

<x-code src="mod/demo-1.js" section="loop"/>

<x-widget name="demo-1" $text="Try it! But prepare to wait a bit."/>

## Fifty times faster with __getImageData()__

The `getImageData()` function returns a typed array: __[Uint8ClampedArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8ClampedArray)__.
All elements of such array are integers clamped between 0 and 255 inclusive.
Pixels are stored rows per rows starting at the top of the image. In a row,
pixels are stored from left to right. Each pixel needs 4 items: red, green, and
alpha.

Changing the color of a pixel is as simple as puting values in this array.

<x-code src="mod/demo-2.js" section="getImageData"/>

Here is the new ploting loop:
<x-code src="mod/demo-2.js" section="loop"/>

<x-widget name="demo-2" $text="Using typed arrays is much more faster."/>

## Better looking

With this new technique it is now possible to make dots, that are hitten
more often, lighter.

The change is minimal:
<x-code>data[ 1 + (((xd|xd) + W * (yd|yd)) << 2) ]++;</x-code>

<x-widget name="demo-3" $text="Better looking for same speed!"/>

We can also use different colors to show what transformation has been choosen per pixel:
* __A__ is green.
* __B__ is red.
* __C__ is white.
* __D__ is blue.

<x-widget name="demo-4" $text="With different colors..."/>

It seems that when the __C__ transformation is choosen a pixel from anywhere
will get into the bottom right leaf. It's like an attractor.

But we are here to talk about speed, not math.
So how can we be faster.

## The way to _asm.js_

<x-widget name="demo-5" $text="Home made random generator."/>
